# icacoe - Kotlin

a tictactoe app created as an Android App example using Kotlin and Redux

## Overview

This is actually my first time ever using Kotlin. Much of what I know about Android comes from development starting way back in 2014 when I studied developing android using Java and BOTH Eclipse and Android Studio. Though I prefer declarative UI, this is a good reminder of how to interact with imperative. After revisting imperative UI, I really don't miss having to deal with the synchronicity of it across all abstractions.

## Outstanding Tasks

- RetroFit2 / HTTP
- redux_thunk actions and dispatch
